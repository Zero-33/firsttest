# firsttest
Ok, this is another test!
and still I'm getting confused how it should work with atom
So I'll add another line
Ok, so now I realise that 2 factor authentication, when I set that up before even using git or Atom
has meant authemtication issues, but they only show up as login problems
So I have had to change passwords etc because it wasn't notifying the issues of 2 factor.
